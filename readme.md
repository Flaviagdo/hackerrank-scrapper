## HACKERRANK SOLUTIONS

This repo contains:
1. Code to scrap hackerrank to get your submitted solutions
2. Submissions I have submitted on hackerrank for quick revision for myself

Known issues: 
Currently getting the last submitted solution from the submission list assuming the last submission was the solved one.

Challenges faced:
1. Tried installing notify2 to give notification when the downloads are complete but is same needs additional installations for mac, so moving to a nodejs solution for the same.

NOTE: This repository is new, please feel free to ask/ suggest something. Cheers!
